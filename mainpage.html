  <p>The period 2016-19 is an exciting time for Scottish Education. Our children
and young peopleâ€™s futures are at the forefront of national and local policy.</p>
<p>  We want Argyll and
Bute to be the best place to grow up. We want young people and families to remain in this area, and be attracted to live here.<br>
This strategy will clearly identify the Education Service vision and embed this throughout Our Children, Their Future. High level objectives will deliver this vision, with associated priority actions. It is the responsibility of everyone within the Education Service to contribute to the delivery of these priority actions. </p>
<p>  While plans at all levels require to be linked to our high level objectives, there will continue to be flexibility to allow schools and services to
respond to the needs of their own communities.</p>
