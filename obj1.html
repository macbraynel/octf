        <p>The curriculum includes a broad range of experiences which are planned for children and young people through their education, to help every child and young person to develop knowledge, skills and attributes for success in learning, life and work.</p>
        <p>Research and evidence consistently demonstrates the direct link between poverty and deprivation and lower attainment and achievement. We also accept the direct link between underachievement in literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing and sustaining
          positive post school destinations.</p>
        <p>In order to address this, our vision is founded on a high level of ambition for all children and young people.</p>
        <p>The three pillars of literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing underpin the entire 3 to 18 curriculum across all subject areas, and will be a key focus for Education Services in implementing Our Children, Their Future.</p>
