        <p>Education services gather, analyse and report on a wide range of performanceinformation which allow us to deliver services effectively and demonstrate that we are continually improving outcomes for children and young people. For example, we use
          information about the progress of our children and young people to inform the approaches to learning and teaching in the classroom.</p>
        <p>
          The National Improvement Framework will collect national data on theachievement of Curriculum for Excellence levels for literacy and numeracy at the end of P1, P4, P7 and S3, based on teacher judgement and informed by standardised testing. Nationally
          produced standardised assessments for literacy and numeracy will be available for use from 2017, and will contribute to the much wider range of data that teachers use to assess, track and monitor the progress of children.
        </p>
