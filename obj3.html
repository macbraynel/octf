        <p>In Argyll and Bute, we work together to ensure children and young people experience a positive start that supports and nurtures as well as builds firm foundations for later life. These steps begin before our children are born. We know that children develop faster in the first few years of life than at any other time so, to make an impact and ensure we tackle potential disadvantage, this is a priority area for us.<br />We will continue to improve the way we work together with partners and families. A<br />number of key initiatives have been developed under the Argyll and Bute Early Years Collaborative (EYC) to help us with this. The EYC is a national approach targeting how we improve the life chances of our children by:<br />• testing changes to how we do things<br />• measuring these changes to see if they lead to improvements, and<br />• spreading the approaches that work.<br />In Argyll and Bute, key developments that will lead to the achievement of the stretch<br />aims include The Argyll and Bute Family Pathway and The Developmental Milestone Toolkit.<br />The Education Service provides Early Learning and Childcare services (ELC) either directly or through commissioning arrangements with private and voluntary providers or through registered childminders. Children over 3 years of age, and some 2 years olds, have an entitlement to up to 600 hours of free early learning or childcare each year.</p>
