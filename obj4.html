        <p>The overarching aim for the Argyll and Bute Community Planning Partnership is to grow the population through economic development. Argyll and Bute offers outstanding opportunities for business growth and features many outstanding employers with globally recognised branding and cutting edge technologies. For that growth to be realised, our industries need a workforce with the right skills, attitudes and capacities.
