<p>We recognise that most of a child’s development takes place outwith our schools and ELC settings therefore the role of families and carers is critical to ensuring our children and young people succeed. We want to support families to engage meaningfully in their child’s education and to be part of leading improvements with schools. We believe it is time to establish a different relationship with parents and carers that reflects this central role for them in the development of education services in Argyll and Bute at a school and an authority level.<br />We will empower parents and carers to be part of the decisions that are taken in<br />respect of their children’s education and development, and to work along with the<br />staff in each school on improvement planning. We will engage parents and carers in dialogue around the new duties on education authorities, new approaches to learning and ultimately their role in their children’s education.<br />Consulting with children and young people and encouraging meaningful<br />participation is not simply a preferred approach, but is a requirement placed upon professionals. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places a duty on local authorities to consult with children and young people and highlights the importance of adopting appropriate consultation methods to ensure young people are able to participate effectively in decisions that affect their<br />lives. The Education (Scotland) Act 2016 strengthens children’s voices in matters that affect them and also extends the rights of children with additional support needs.<br />Careful consideration needs to be given to the ways in which we consult with children<br />and young people to allow them to participate effectively. This will include young children and those with additional support needs. We also need to be clear about what happens in response to the views that are shared.<br />We will ensure that strong partnerships are created and maintained with local<br />bodies including businesses, third sector organisations and community groups. This<br />will broaden and deepen the curricular experiences offered to children and young<br />people by our educational establishments. We will work in partnership and consult<br />appropriately with Parent Councils and relevant community bodies or groups when<br />considering the quality of provision delivered in our educational establishments in accordance with the principles of the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015.<em></em></p>
