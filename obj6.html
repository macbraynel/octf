<p>Research has demonstrated a strong link between the quality of educational experience enjoyed by our children and young people and the standards and competence of our teaching professionals. Leadership in schools at all levels is essential in ensuring that experience is of the very highest standard.<br />Head Teachers and teachers who are empowered, and empower others, have a strong record of ensuring the highest quality of learning and teaching. This ensures that all children and young people achieve the best possible outcomes. Our approach ensures a consistent focus on career long professional development from the initial teacher education, through the various career stages to system leadership across the education sector. This is illustrated in the diagram below.<br />Leadership for continuous school improvement is most effective where every member of the school staff is empowered to lead and where every member of staff develops their ability to lead.<br />We also recognise the challenges of recruiting teaching and support staff in a large rural area like Argyll and Bute. We are committed to growing our own future staff, future leaders and applying creative solutions. We work with a range of partners to achieve this including innovative work with Argyll College UHI to deliver a post graduate diploma in education locally in Argyll and Bute. This approach is more sustainable and contributes to developing career options for people to stay in Argyll and Bute.</p>
